# Abstract

# Established business
The team behind Birdchain has been part of [the European-based company JSC “Vertex”](https://rekvizitai.vz.lt/en/company/vertex/).  In 2009 Vertex started our A2P SMS aggregation business called [VertexSMS](https://vertexsms.com/?lang=en). Since then [VertexSMS](https://vertexsms.com/?lang=en) has delivered more than 2.6 billion SMS messages globally for various international brands, including Western Union, MasterCard, SalesForce, TransferGo and many others.
 
Vertex is a profitable company. In 2015 Vertex received award for being the fastest growing IT company in Lithuania and Vertex continued the growth in 2016 as well. Moreover, in 2012 Vertex was recognized as one of the fastest growing companies in Latvia.
In early 2015 Vertex was certified in the field of information security management and received an ISO/IEC 27001 certificate. The certificate is adapted through all of our businesses that are held in Vertex headquarters: dating sites, bulk SMS sending systems and rent-to-own company. Now these procedures are being applied to Birdchain.

The combined per country turnover and EBITDA of Vertex is growing every year. 

|  | Turnover | EBITDA |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
2017* | 4-5M euro* | 20%* | * Estimations
2016 | 3-4M euro | 19% |
2015 | 3-4M euro | 17% |
2014 | 2-3M euro | 18% |
2013 | 2-3M euro | 17% |
2012 | 2-3M euro | 16% |

Vertex owns several brands - VertexSMS is one of them. Founders of the company gathered Birdchain team members from other brands. It means that members of the team of Birdchain know each other and have been working together for years. This decision eliminates possibilities of team not being able to work together and creates really healthy, creative and productive working atmosphere.

Team of Birdchain are individuals with a set of unique experiences to make Birdchain fly. Of course, most of the Birdchain team have experience of working in global A2P SMS market and shares an extended know-how about regulations, key players, technologies and other aspects. Other team members are experts in marketing, business development, law, and software development. 

The founding team has successfully co-launched several different businesses: 

**Social network** with more than 1 000 000 unique users (flirtas.lt, flirts.lv, flirtak.pl, teidi.ee and others). This business allowed our team to design and test new ways of advertisement. It exposed us several unique user experience patterns that led us to developing very effective campaigns. Moreover, we learned a lot about software and app development in the field of user communication. We will adapt this knowledge in Birdchain app and service.

In 2013 we invested in manufacturing of **advanced micro lasers** (integratedoptics.com). Today we manufacture the smallest lasers in the world and our company is considered as one of the most promising Eastern European start-ups. Currently we have more orders for our lasers than we manufacture. 

**Retail**. In 2013 we launched the first in the region rent-to-buy service (bekredito.lt).

# Value of the Token
Our goal is to create strong token which would be useful for our contributors and could circulate in the world easily. We believe that circulation and spread of the token is the key to its value. The more people and companies would use our token, the more it would be used, the stronger it will be. Here are some key points that makes BIRD token to stand out:
1. **Low initial cost**. During the ICO, the BIRD will be sold at the lowest price to create a higher incentive for contributors. 
2. **Token flexibility**. When the BIRD value and demand increases, it can be fragmented into 18 decimals to serve the market needs. 
3. **Unique currency**. Exclusively BIRD tokens are used for purchasing Birdchain A2P service and rewarding Birdchain app users. Ensuring the BIRD token has a real demand. 
4. **Favorable viability**. To have a sustainable business it needs only 100 000 app installs. Each phone can sell about 100 SMS per day on a very conservative approach.
5. **High desirability**. Providing the possibility of an income to its users, the Birdchain App is highly appealing to the public. The more users install the app, the more SMS flux it creates meaning a faster BIRD rotation, demand and appreciation. 
6. New features and higher **BIRD circulation**. We will drive demand and circulation of BIRDs with new Birdchain features and services.
7. **Embracing the competition**. Our A2P SMS service will be appealing to all companies that look for lower SMS price and high quality service. 
8. Detailed **financial forecast**. Check it out here: [Finances](#finances)

## GBI
The main goal of Birdchain is to disrupt the A2P SMS market with blockchain technology. Make it better, faster, more transparent and fair-priced. Although, we believe soon it will become obvious that Birdchain is a lot more than just a (r)evolutionary idea. 

We believe Birdchain will be the first ever (in the history of the world!) non-governmental initiative to create Global Basic Income. 
Depending on a country and market activity users of Birdchain app could be able to earn 30-300 USD per month. It means that Birdchain could create basic passive income for its users globally. 

We see this feature as huge marketing opportunity and a chance to stand out in a global market of messaging apps. 

However, Birdchain does not guarantee any revenue to Birdchain token holder or the user of the Birdchain app. 

# SMS gateway
An Application To Person (A2P) SMS is sent from an application — typically a web app — to a mobile subscriber. There are several types of the most popular A2P SMS:
* SMS notifications;
* SMS-based two-factor authentications;
* Automatic booking confirmations;
* One-time passwords;
* Loyalty programs and marketing messages.

Transactional SMS service is mostly used by social networks and companies which provide services of e-commerce and online retail, travel and transportation, financial services and payments, and gaming. Because of their effectiveness, promotional messages are sent by companies operating in almost all markets.

Some examples of a transactional SMSs:
* G-123456 is your Google verification code.
* Hair Salon appointment reminder: haircut tomorrow at 10:30am with Charles. If you have any questions, please call 0161 5555555.

![SMS stats](https://github.com/Birdchain/whitepaper-business/blob/master/WP%20images/07.png?raw=true)

You may wonder:
> Why do Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Apple and many others high-tech companies want to send SMS? Why would anyone want to use technology from the ‘80s?

Here is why:
* SMS is platform-independent;
* SMS is network-independent;
* SMS is geographically independent;
* SMS is non-proprietary;
* SMS is app-independent (no need to have an app to communicate);
* SMS does not require a data subscription (roaming scenarios for example);
* SMS is by far the most standardized messaging technology.

![Phone users](https://github.com/Birdchain/whitepaper-business/blob/master/WP%20images/06.png?raw=true)

A2P SMS market is expected to grow by around 5% per year and reach $84 billion by 2024. The reasons for A2P growth:
* SMS is the most effective and the cheapest way to reach customers. 98 percent of people read an SMS within three minutes from receiving it and SMS has the highest engagement rate in comparison to emails and OTT apps.

| User Count    | SMS Cost | Email Cost | Adwords Remarketing* | Facebook  | 
| :---          | :---:    | :---:      | :---:                | :---:     |
| CPM**         | 30$      | 15$        | 30$                  | 52.5$     | 
| True View     | 98%      | 22%        | 80%                  | 60%       | 
| Real CPM***   | 31$      | 66$        | 37$                  | 87.5$     | 

* An increase of two-factor authentication and security via SMS. Today personal data is transferred over the web more often than ever before. Seeking to add a security layer, two-factor authentication has become the go-to method for companies that aim to protect their users. Sending an SMS as an authentication has become very popular, because customers usually have a mobile device on them at almost any given moment.
* A 2-way authentication has a staggering 99.9% reachability rate across all mobile users, as long as the number provided is correct. It does not require to have an internet connection. Mobile bandwidth is enough to receive a two-factor authentication or marketing message.
* No need to install additional apps. SMS messages can be received and read on any mobile phone in any network, almost anywhere in the world.

**In the ideal world**, when business wants to conduct an SMS marketing campaign, it has to contact aggregators. Aggregators are companies that mediate between businesses which WANT to send SMSs and operators that CAN send them.
![Ideal SMS path](https://github.com/Birdchain/whitepaper-business/blob/master/WP%20images/IdeaWorld.png?raw=true)

**In real world**, it is not that straightforward.
![Real-world path](https://github.com/Birdchain/whitepaper-business/blob/master/WP%20images/09.png?raw=true)

As an independent aggregator, we see market flaws as opportunities for Birdchain. Birdchain makes the path of SMS sending as straigh as possible.
![Path of the Birdchain](https://github.com/Birdchain/whitepaper-business/blob/master/WP%20images/10.png?raw=true)

**The problems:**
1. People have unlimited SMS plans which they do not use;
2. Companies overpay for the A2P SMS service and are constantly looking for opportunities todecrease the price;

**The solution:**
1. People can automatically sell their unused SMS to businesses via Birdchain instant messaging app. Companies get an up to 6 times cheaper service. People get paid for every single SMS which is sold.

![A2P SMS market growth](https://github.com/Birdchain/whitepaper-business/blob/master/WP%20images/04.png?raw=true)

## How SMS gateway is going to work?

**For end-users of the app** who want to employ their unused SMSs and grant themselves monthly passive income should:
1. Download a Birdchain instant messaging app:
    1. Set Birdchain as a default messaging app;
2. Open settings:
    1. Set the number of SMS they want to be sold*;
    2. Click “Send”;
3. Chat with your friends and family via Birdchain app, while SMS are automatically sold in the
background;
4. Check in-app wallet to track their earnings and number of messages sold.

**For businesses** which are looking for a fairly priced A2P SMS service:
1. Before starting to use the Birdchain service, the company will have to gather a list of phone
numbers (contacts) by itself;
2. The company must visit the Birdchain web-app and log in;
3. The **company must purchase BIRD tokens** in order to send A2P SMSs;
4. The company sets the campaign by taking these steps:
    1. uploading their contacts;
    2. writing the text of the SMS message;
    3. setting the maximum amount (bid) it wants to pay for the campaign;
5. Birdchain analyses the phone numbers and finds the best way to conduct the campaign:
    1. sends SMSs only to the contacts located in the same country;
    2. sends SMS only to the same carrier numbers;
    3. finds the best prices for the campaign;
    4. forms Smart Contracts between the business and every single Birdchain app user whose SMSs are going to be purchased;
6. Birdchain sends out the messages;
7. Birdchain uses blockchain to verify the delivery of every single SMS;
8. When delivery is confirmed and the conditions of the Smart Contract are fulfilled, company bid is equally distributed among all app users whose SMS were used to deliver the messages.

![Sending SMS](https://github.com/Birdchain/whitepaper-business/blob/master/WP%20images/BC-node.png?raw=true)

**What Will Not Birdchain Do?**
1. Birdchain will not provide phone numbers to companies. Birdchain only facilitates the service;
2. Birdchain will not use Birdchain app user contact list;
3. Birdchain will not allow service price to exceed 80 percent of the country’s average;
4. Birdchain will not allow companies to send messages without clearly stating their name;
5. Birdchain will not allow people who received transactional or promotional message to contact the Birdchain app user for 72 hours after receiving it;
6. Birdchain will not collect user’s personal data.

## The Growing Demand
In 2015, Application-to-person (A2P) SMS market was worth $57.3 billion and is forecast to grow to $83 billion by 2024.

![Growing number of SMS](https://github.com/Birdchain/whitepaper-business/blob/master/WP%20images/03.png?raw=true)
![A2P SMS market value](https://github.com/Birdchain/whitepaper-business/blob/master/WP%20images/02.png?raw=true)

Until recent years, SMS marketing also used to be considered fast, safe, and reliable. However, as the market grew, it was monopolized and got distorted. Most of the market is shared amongst a few key players.

Despite these A2P SMS market defects, the demand for this service is increasing every year. As a marketing channel, SMS has some huge advantages: SMS has an open rate of 99% and 90% of consumers read the SMS within the first three minutes of receipt. Also, it has a flexibility to reach one or many customers, and it is the most convenient communication channel to the end user.

## F.A.Q.
**Will Birdchain send messages to my contact list?**
No. Birdchain will send SMS messages only to numbers that are provided by company. Businesses will have to collect their database of contacts by its own. Birdchain will only facilitate the service of A2P SMS distribution.

**How will operators react to your service?**
It is unlikely for operators to take any real actions in the next three-four years. First, we assume SMS delivery is of low importance to them as it generates relatively small profits. Second, we assume operators will not risk to get sued for privacy violations (reading private messages) and even if they would win, the cost of victory would be too high. Third, if Birdchain app user will not send more messages per day/month than he/she can send according to his/her operator’s Fair Usage Agreement, operator will not have any pretext to check what messages were sent from the phone.

**How Birdchain will protect privacy of a sender?**
The number of the sender will be visible to the person who received SMS. There is no way to avoid it at the moment. We understand that this might be a drawback for some potential app users so, from the earliest versions of Birdchain, we will implement several security features:

First, we will not send transactional or promotional messages to contact list of the Birdchain app user - the message will be delivered from someone else's phone. 

Second, the name of sending company will be clearly stated in the message text so that receiver would know who to contact in case he/she wanted to cancel the subscription.

Third, for 72 hours after sending the promotional or transactional message Birdchain app will block all incoming calls and messages from that specific number. It means that person who received SMS will not be able to contact person whose phone was used to send that SMS.

**How much money people will be able to earn?**
Answer to this question highly depends on a country and demand of Birdchain service. Rough calculations suggest that under average conditions Birdchain app user in USA could earn 50-100 USD per month. More or less the same amount could be earned in most of the world. Exceptions: in developing countries earnings can be lower due to lower prices of regular A2P SMS service; under perfect conditions in Germany and Belgium monthly earnings could reach 300 euros. These are theoretical estimations and may be different after applying Birdchain in real life. 

*Please note that Birdchain itself does not guarantee any payments to its users.*

## Purpose of the Token
Birdchain token is NOT AN ASSET NOR A SECURITY. It is a utility token. Birdchain tokens do not represent or confer any ownership right or stake, share, security, or equivalent rights, or any right to receive dividends, other payments, intellectual property rights, or any other form of participation in or relating to the project described in this white paper and/or in Birdchain or any of its affiliates.
The Birdchain token holders are only entitled to use the A2P SMS distribution service as described in this document if successfully developed, or to resell the tokens.

The BIRD token itself will be based on Ethereum, a blockchain-based computing platform. Ethereum allows smart contracts, distributed computer programs that can facilitate online contractual agreements in a cryptographically secure manner.

Smart contracts are what enables the existence of Birdchain token as a truly transparent and decentralized service. This technology also ensures that Birdchain eliminates the need for intermediaries and having a central authority you need to trust. Through smart contracts the complex process of choosing peers, tracking delivery, and facilitating bidding/payment can be described in the contract itself, while still running on the distributed Ethereum network and taking advantage of the blockchain features.

BIRDs are distributed and kept on the main Ethereum network. To optimise the transaction cost and performance, all micro transactions are processed off-chain and only the final stakes are returned to the Ethereum network. We believe in idea of keeping tokens on Ethereum and see it as a bank platform which is excellent for entering exchange markets.

## Are Birdchain tokens Securities?
**No**, Birdchain tokens are **NOT** and are not intended to be securities, financial instruments, or investment products of any kind.

For example, with a purposes of financial regulation in the European Union a “security” is often defined with a reference to “transferable security” within the meaning of the EU Directive on markets in financial instruments (MiFID)[13]. According to MiFID, “transferable securities” means those classes of securities which are negotiable on the capital market, with an exception of instruments of payment, such as:
1. shares in companies and other securities equivalent to shares in companies, partnerships or other entities, and depositary receipts in respect of shares;
2. bonds or other forms of securitised debt, including depositary receipts in respect of such securities;
3. any other securities giving the right to acquire or sell any such transferable securities or giving rise to a cash settlement determined by reference to transferable securities, currencies, interest rates or yields, commodities or other indices or measures.
BIRD does not qualify as “transferable security” for the above purposes.

BIRD as a utility token in the future will only provide opportunity to access Birdchain services. The aim of the BIRD is to make it possible to exchange SMSs between the people wishing to access them and the people wishing to dispose extra SMSs.

The BIRD has a specific utility use case. It serves a crucial role in settlement-making with a potentially very large number of mobile phones on the Birdchain network by allowing a fast and open blockchain-based transaction protocol that would not be possible using fiat currency. If the BIRD was not be based on the blockchain technology, it would be similar to purchasing a ticket or any other document which proves that the person has a right to use a particular service.

# Exchanges
We believe that it is better to get listed in one major exchange than in couple of small ones. It will be easier for both: our contributors and companies that will use our tokens to purchase Birdchain services. We will focus on getting BIRD token listed on **Binance**, **Bittrex**, or **Kucoin**. Our calculations are that token will be listed within a month after our ICO.
