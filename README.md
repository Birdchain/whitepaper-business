# Abstract
A team of the Birdchain is **not** a start-up. It is part of a parent company named Vertex. Vertex is a profitable company with a team of experienced professionals whose professionalism and skills were tested in action. The founding team has successfully co-launched several different businesses. 
 
Birdchain is a decentralized application (Dapp), similar to instant messenger, for Android smartphones. The big difference is that Birdchain will allow its users to make a monthly passive income. Simultaneously Birdchain will provide companies with higher quality and better-priced services: A2P SMS distribution, content engagement, personal data marketplace and others. The main goal of Birdchain app is to create internal economics, where its users will be able to earn, transfer (to exchanges) or spend their BIRD tokens without leaving the app. 

All features of the Birdchain are designed to create strong BIRD token. It stands out with low initial cost and token flexibility, as a unique currency with favorable viability. 

The official Android app presentation is planned at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in 2019. 

In short:
1) Birdchain is DApp that rewards;
2) The intelligent features system create internal economics and allow people to earn and spend money on the app;
3) Dapps are the future of the blockchain. Everyone at the moment invests in protocols rather than actual applications. A comparison: whether to invest in HTML protocol or an Uber app? 

**Join the ICO with the potential of real adaptability in the future.**


# Established business
The team behind Birdchain has been a part of  [the European-based company JSC “Vertex”](https://rekvizitai.vz.lt/en/company/vertex/).  In 2009 Vertex started our A2P SMS aggregation business called [VertexSMS](https://vertexsms.com/?lang=en). Since then [VertexSMS](https://vertexsms.com/?lang=en) has delivered more than 2.6 billion SMS messages globally for various international brands, including Western Union, MasterCard, SalesForce, TransferGo, and many others.

![Clients](https://github.com/Birdchain/whitepaper-business/blob/master/WP%20images/BirdChain-Whitepaper-Clients.jpg)
 
Vertex is a profitable company. In 2015 Vertex received an award for being the fastest growing ITT company in Lithuania. Vertex continued to grow in 2016 too. Moreover, in 2012 Vertex was recognized as one of the fastest growing companies in Latvia.

In early 2015, Vertex was certified in the field of information security management and received an ISO/IEC 27001 certificate. The certificate is adapted to all of our businesses which are held in Vertex headquarters: dating sites, bulk SMS sending systems, and a rent-to-own company. Now all these procedures are being applied to Birdchain.

The combined per country turnover and EBITDA of Vertex is growing every year. 

|  | Turnover | EBITDA |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
2017* | 4-5M euro* | 20%* | * Estimations
2016 | 3-4M euro | 19% |
2015 | 3-4M euro | 17% |
2014 | 2-3M euro | 18% |
2013 | 2-3M euro | 17% |
2012 | 2-3M euro | 16% |

Vertex owns several brands and VertexSMS is one of them. Company founders gathered Birdchain team members from other brands. It means that the members of Birdchain team know each other well and have been working together for years. This decision eliminates possibilities of the team not being able to work together and creates really healthy, creative, and productive working atmosphere.

Birdchain team members are individuals with a set of unique experiences to make Birdchain fly. Of course, most of them have experience of working in a global A2P SMS market and share an extended know-how about regulations, key players, technologies, and other aspects. Other team members are experts in marketing, business development, law, and software development. 

The founding team has successfully co-launched several different businesses: 

**Social network** with more than 1 000 000 unique users (flirtas.lt, flirts.lv, flirtak.pl, teidi.ee, and others). This business allowed our team to design and test new ways of advertisement. It exposed several unique user experience patterns to us which led to developing very efficient campaigns. Moreover, we learned a lot about software and dapp development in the user communication field. We will adopt this knowledge to the Birdchain dapp and service.

In 2013, we invested in **advanced microlaser manufacturer** (integratedoptics.com). Today we manufacture the smallest lasers in the world and our company is considered to be one of the most promising Eastern European start-ups. Currently, we have more orders for our lasers than we are able to manufacture. 


**Retail**. In 2013 we launched the first in the region rent-to-buy service (bekredito.lt).

# Birdchain. The app that rewards
Birdchain is a decentralized app that will help people to make a passive income and simultaneously will offer cheaper and better services to businesses. All the features and the demand for them are based on our work experience, insights, and knowledge.

The first version for commercial consumption will be complete in 6 months. After the ICO, it will receive money transfers and will be capable of earn income to the app holder. Our contributors will be able to test the version first. We will take into account their feedback and will improve our app and tune it in line with the recommendations, for the perfect launching.

The first version of the application will hold an interface, enabling communication with friends and family, and a possibility to sell unused SMS and also an opportunity to amass cryptocurrency from SMS messages. We will start with this feature because it has the highest potential of money earning in the beginning. Additionally, we have specialized in SMS delivery business for nearly ten years and hold the deep understanding of market specifics and SMS transmission technologies. Also, this will allow users to start earning money from the very first day. 

Next step will be taking on the other features described in this WP, which will allow people to earn money: Content Engagement, Personal Data Marketplace, and 3rd party in-app mini games.

All methods of money earning will be based on the volunteering principle. App users will be personally able to choose the means and amount of possible earnings.

We will officially present the app at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in 2019.

# Raising value of the token
Our goal is to create a strong token which would be useful for our contributors and could circulate in the world easily. We believe that circulation and spread of the token is the key to its value. The more people and companies would use our token, the more it would be used, the stronger it will be. Here are some key points that make BIRD token to stand out:
1. **Low initial cost**. During the ICO, the BIRD will be sold at the lowest price to create a higher incentive for contributors. 
2. **Token flexibility**. When the BIRD value and demand increases, it can be fragmented into 18 decimals to serve the market needs. 
3. **Unique currency**. Exclusively BIRD tokens are used for purchasing Birdchain A2P service and rewarding Birdchain app users. Ensuring the BIRD token has a real demand. 
4. **Favorable viability**. To have a sustainable business it needs only 100 000 app installs. Each phone can sell about 100 SMS per day on a very conservative approach.
5. **High desirability**. Providing the possibility of an income to its users, the Birdchain App is highly appealing to the public. The more users install the app, the more SMS flux it creates meaning a faster BIRD rotation, demand and appreciation. 
6. New features and higher **BIRD circulation**. We will drive demand and circulation of BIRDs with new Birdchain features and services.
7. **Embracing the competition**. Our A2P SMS service will be appealing to all companies that look for lower SMS price and high-quality service. 
8. Detailed **financial forecast**. Check it out here: [Finances](#finances)

## GBI - Global Basic Income
The main goal of Birdchain is to disrupt the A2P SMS market with blockchain technology. To make it better, faster, more transparent, and fair-priced. However, we believe that soon it will become obvious that Birdchain is much more than just a (r)evolutionary idea. 

We believe that Birdchain will be the first ever (in the history of the world!) non-governmental initiative to create Global Basic Income. 

Depending on a country and market activity, Birdchain app users should be able to earn 30-300 USD per month. This means that Birdchain could create basic passive income for its users globally. 

We see this feature as a huge marketing opportunity and a chance to stand out in the global market of messaging apps. 
However, Birdchain does not guarantee any revenue to Birdchain token holder or Birdchain app user. 

# SMS gateway
An Application To Person (A2P) SMS is sent from an application — typically a web app — to a mobile subscriber. There are several types of the most popular A2P SMS:
* SMS notifications;
* SMS-based two-factor authentications;
* Automatic booking confirmations;
* One-time passwords;
* Loyalty programs and marketing messages.

Transactional SMS service is mostly used by social networks and companies which provide services of e-commerce and online retail, travel and transportation, financial services and payments, and gaming. Because of their effectiveness, promotional messages are sent by companies operating in almost all markets. 

Some examples of a transactional SMSs:
* G-123456 is your verification code.
* Hair Salon appointment reminder: haircut tomorrow at 10:30AM with Charles. If you have any questions, please call 0161 5555555.

![SMS stats](https://github.com/Birdchain/whitepaper-business/blob/master/WP%20images/07.png?raw=true)

You may wonder:
> Why do Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Apple and many others high-tech companies want to send SMS? Why would anyone want to use technology from the ‘80s?

Here is why:
* SMS is platform-independent;
* SMS is network-independent;
* SMS is geographically independent;
* SMS is non-proprietary;
* SMS is app-independent (no need to have an app to communicate);
* SMS does not require a data subscription (roaming scenarios for example);
* SMS is by far the most standardized messaging technology.

![Phone users](https://github.com/Birdchain/whitepaper-business/blob/master/WP%20images/06.png?raw=true)

A2P SMS market is expected to grow by around 5% per year and reach $84 billion by 2024. The reasons for A2P growth:
* SMS is the most effective and the cheapest way to reach customers. 98 percent of people read an SMS within three minutes from receiving it and SMS has the highest engagement rate in comparison to emails and OTT apps. 

| User Count    | SMS Cost | Email Cost | Adwords Remarketing* | Facebook  | 
| :---          | :---:    | :---:      | :---:                | :---:     |
| CPM**         | 30$      | 15$        | 30$                  | 52.5$     | 
| True View     | 98%      | 22%        | 80%                  | 60%       | 
| Real CPM***   | 31$      | 66$        | 37$                  | 87.5$     | 

* An increase in two-factor authentication and security via SMS. Today personal data is transferred over the web more often than ever before. Seeking to add a security layer, two-factor authentication has become the go-to method for companies that aim to protect their users. Sending an SMS as an authentication has become very popular because customers usually have a mobile device on them at almost any given moment.
* A 2-way authentication has a staggering 99.9% reachability rate across all mobile users, as long as the number provided is correct. It does not require to have an internet connection. Mobile bandwidth is enough to receive a two-factor authentication or marketing message. 
* No need to install additional apps. SMS messages can be received and read on any mobile phone in any network, almost anywhere in the world.

**In the ideal world**, when a business wants to conduct an SMS marketing campaign, it has to contact aggregators. Aggregators are companies that mediate between businesses which WANT to send SMS and operators that CAN send them. 
![Ideal SMS path](https://github.com/Birdchain/whitepaper-business/blob/master/WP%20images/IdeaWorld.png?raw=true)

**In the real world**, it is not that straightforward.
![Real-world path](https://github.com/Birdchain/whitepaper-business/blob/master/WP%20images/09.png?raw=true)

As an independent aggregator, we see market flaws as opportunities for Birdchain. Birdchain makes the path of SMS sending as straight as possible.
![Path of the Birdchain](https://github.com/Birdchain/whitepaper-business/blob/master/WP%20images/10.png?raw=true)

**The problems:**
1. People have unlimited SMS plans which they do not use;
2. Companies overpay for the A2P SMS service and are constantly looking for opportunities to decrease the price;

**The solution:**
1. People can automatically sell their unused SMS to businesses via Birdchain instant messaging app. Companies get an up to 6 times cheaper service. People get paid for every single SMS which is sold.

![A2P SMS market growth](https://github.com/Birdchain/whitepaper-business/blob/master/WP%20images/04.png?raw=true)

## How is SMS gateway going to work?

**For end-users of the app** who want to employ their unused SMSs and grant themselves monthly passive income should:
1. Download a Birdchain instant messaging app:
    1. Set Birdchain as a default messaging app;
2. Open settings:
    1. Set the number of SMS they want to be sold*;
    2. Click “Send”;
3. Chat with your friends and family via Birdchain app, while SMS is automatically sold in the
background;
4. Check in-app wallet to track their earnings and number of messages sold.

**For businesses** which are looking for a fairly priced A2P SMS service:
1. Before starting to use the Birdchain service, the company will have to gather a list of phone numbers (contacts) by itself;
2. The company must visit the Birdchain web-app and log in;
3. The **company must purchase BIRD tokens** in order to send A2P SMSs;
4. The company sets the campaign by taking these steps:
    1. uploading their contacts;
    2. writing the text of the SMS message;
    3. setting the maximum amount (bid) it wants to pay for the campaign;
5. Birdchain analyses the phone numbers and finds the best way to conduct the campaign:
    1. sends SMSs only to the contacts located in the same country;
    2. sends SMS only to the same carrier numbers;
    3. finds the best prices for the campaign;
    4. forms Smart Contracts between the business and every single Birdchain app user whose SMS are going to be purchased;
6. Birdchain sends out the messages;
7. Birdchain uses blockchain to verify the delivery of every single SMS;
8. When delivery is confirmed and the conditions of the Smart Contract are fulfilled, company bid is equally distributed among all app users whose SMS were used to deliver the messages.

![Sending SMS](https://github.com/Birdchain/whitepaper-business/blob/master/WP%20images/BC-node.png?raw=true)

**What Will Not Birdchain Do?**
1. Birdchain will not provide phone numbers to companies. Birdchain only facilitates the service;
2. Birdchain will not use Birdchain app user contact list;
3. Birdchain will not allow service price to exceed 80 percent of the country’s average;
4. Birdchain will not allow companies to send messages without clearly stating their name;
5. Birdchain will not allow people who received transactional or promotional message to contact the Birdchain app user for 72 hours after receiving it;
6. Birdchain will not collect user’s personal data.

## The Growing Demand
In 2015, Application-to-person (A2P) SMS market was worth $57.3 billion and is forecast to grow to $83 billion by 2024.

![Growing number of SMS](https://github.com/Birdchain/whitepaper-business/blob/master/WP%20images/03.png?raw=true)
![A2P SMS market value](https://github.com/Birdchain/whitepaper-business/blob/master/WP%20images/02.png?raw=true)

Until recent years, SMS marketing also used to be considered fast, safe, and reliable. However, as the market grew, it was monopolized and got distorted. Most of the market is shared amongst a few key players.

Despite these A2P SMS market defects, the demand for this service is increasing every year. As a marketing channel, SMS has some huge advantages: SMS has an open rate of 99% and 90% of consumers read the SMS within the first three minutes of receipt. Also, it has a flexibility to reach one or many customers, and it is the most convenient communication channel to the end user.

![Growing SMS price](https://github.com/Birdchain/whitepaper-business/blob/master/WP%20images/WP-Grafikai01.png?raw=true)
 


## SMS F.A.Q.
**Will Birdchain send messages to my contact list?**
No. Birdchain will send SMS messages only to the numbers provided by the company. Businesses will have to collect their own contact database. Birdchain will only facilitate the A2P SMS distribution service.

**How will operators react to your service?**
It is unlikely for operators to take any real action in the next three-four years. First of all, we assume that SMS delivery is of low importance to them as it generates relatively small profits. Secondly, we assume that operators are not going to risk getting sued for privacy violation (reading private messages) and even if they won, the cost of victory would be too high. Thirdly, if a Birdchain app user does not send more messages per day/month than they can send according to their operator’s Fair Usage Agreement, the operator will not have any pretext to check what messages were sent from the phone.

**How will Birdchain protect the privacy of a sender?**
Sender’s number will be visible to the person who receives SMS. At the moment, there is no way to avoid it. We understand that this might be a drawback for some potential app users so, from the earliest Birdchain versions, we are going to implement several security features:

Firstly, we will not send transactional or promotional messages to Birdchain app user’s contact list. The message will be delivered from someone else's phone. 

Secondly, the name of the sending company will be clearly stated in the message text so that receiver would know who to contact in case he/she wanted to cancel the subscription.

Thirdly, for the first 72 hours after sending the promotional or transactional message, Birdchain app will block all incoming calls and messages from the specific number to which it will be sent. It means that the person who receives an SMS will not be able to contact the person whose phone was used to deliver it.

**How much money will people be able to earn?**
The answer to this question strongly depends on the country and demand for the Birdchain service. Rough calculations suggest that under average conditions a Birdchain app user in the USA could earn **50-100 USD** per month. More or less the same amount could be earned in most parts of the world. Exceptions: in developing countries earnings may be lower due to lower regular A2P SMS service prices; under perfect conditions in Germany and Belgium monthly earnings could reach up to 300 euros. These are theoretical estimations and may be different after applying Birdchain in real life. 

*Please note that Birdchain itself does not guarantee any payments to its users.*

# Content engagement
One of the easiest ways for people to start earning money will be the involvement in the content engagement. Foremost, we will develop the opportunity to receive BIRD Tokens for previewing the adverts. Later, we will install a live stream and provide other opportunities for the content broadcast.

## How is content engagement going to work?

**Video viewing**

For every video ad preview, users will get a reward for a certain amount of tokens. To accomplish this, users ought to open a designated app section and begin previewing the adverts. After the video preview, BIRD tokens would be automatically transferred to their account.

Companies will be able to choose the amount they are willing to pay for a video preview and indicate their target group demographics: location, age, gender and other data. The company will only have to indicate the amount their want to assign (and transfer the sum as BIRD tokens), then choose the maximum amount of payment for a single preview, the number of times the entry could be previewed by the same person, and the preview video ad duration required, to merit earning the preview payment. The price of a single preview will be calculated accordingly. In case the company's campaign budget is not expended, the remaining amount will return to the company's wallet.

**Live stream**

At a later stage, we will enable users to create and broadcast the content within the Birdchain app. The viewers will be able to stream the content for free or after paying the number of BIRD tokens set by the content generating user. In both cases, viewers will be able to additionally donate BIRD tokens if they'll like the content.

At the moment, the best example of such merit-based gaining would be the twitch.tv platform where people share how they play games and are rewarded by other players/viewers. Indeed, that is not the only adaptation of this feature. Users will be able to share moments of their life, travel or adventure.

## Tested concept
This feature has the potential of becoming the main momentum of Bird token circulation. The team developing Birdchain has previously engaged in developing the social network with over 1 million of unique users. The content engagement feature has proved to be very successful. 

Experimenting with new opportunities for members to broadcast adverts, we have developed a system allowing granting rewards for users for previewing video ads. The results of user involvement were exceptionally good. Within a 6-month period since the feature launching, **80 percent** of the online users were using it. 

As it turned out, people aren't against viewing corporate advertisements multiple times, as long as they are getting at least a symbolical reward for that. The main users' request was to be able to view more varied and diverse advertisements. 

## Content F.A.Q.
Comming soon

# In-app mini-games
To create an internal economy and promote BIRD tokens' circulation, we must create a space where our app users would be able to spend the earned tokens. A marketplace of in-app applications will that space where users will be able to install additional add-ons, increasing the efficiency of the Birdchain app and aiding them in the creation of the perfect IM application. However, the greatest potential we are seeing in the growing mobile gaming market. 

![Mobile game market](https://github.com/Birdchain/whitepaper-business/blob/master/WP%20images/MobileGames2.png)

## How are mini-games going to work?
The Birdchain app will hold a marketplace where users will be able to download the needed extension. It could be a work-friendly app (such as a calendar, work scheduler, or a calculator), or some uncomplicated games.

In the starting stages of the Birdchain app development, the Birdchain team themselves will present several simple yet engaging games, for users to spend their earned valuables. For example, we know from previous experience the slot machine game will be very successful.

At the same time, we will create the SDK (software development kit) to third parties, so they would be able to develop games and apps customizable to the Birdchain application. Those will be placed on a marketplace and app users will be able to find and select the most enchanting ones for them.

Birdchain app users will pay with BIRD tokens for the installed applications and games. Third parties will be able to choose the preferred monetization method.  We expect about 20 percent of the apps to be sold by "pay and hold" principle, and the remaining will be charged by subscription.

## Mini-games F.A.Q.
Comming soon

# Personal data marketplace
Facebook, Google, Apple and other companies collect and sell not only the demographic data of their users but also information about their hobbies and habits. And people get no benefits for providing this information. Birdchain Personal data marketplace reinstates the personal data processing to the people.

*Important: Birdchain will not store any personal consumers' information and will not share it with other parties, with the exception of the information necessary for providing Birdchain services and helping people to earn valuables.*

## How is marketplace going to work?
This tool will work in two ways: it will allow companies to conduct surveys or to directly purchase their personal data.

In the app settings, people will be able to set whether they want additional earnings by participating in such surveys and by providing their personal information to third parties. The Birdchain app will require entering some demographic information about the user.

**Surveys**

Based upon to users' demographic information, the company will have an opportunity to offer users to participate in surveys and be rewarded for participation. The remuneration amount will be set by the company.

![Birdchain Survey](https://github.com/Birdchain/whitepaper-business/blob/master/WP%20images/BirdChain-Whitepaper-Survey.jpg?raw=true)

We will notify the randomly selected user about the possibility to share their opinion and gain BIRD tokens. They will be provided with company's information, the survey theme and the remuneration amount for the answers. The user will be rewarded after completing the questionnaire.

**Personal data**
This feature is more expensive than surveys, but companies can acquire considerably more valuable information.

Companies seeking to purchase Birdchain users' personal data will be required to indicate the search target, sample size, the type of information they want to receive and how much they are willing to pay for personal data of a single user.

![Birdchain Personal data](https://github.com/Birdchain/whitepaper-business/blob/master/WP%20images/BirdChain-Whitepaper-Personal_Data.jpg?raw=true)

The Birdchain app will randomly select individuals from the list of users that meet the company's specified criteria. Users will be notified about the possibility of selling their personal data. They will be provided with company's information, the required data specificity and the amount of BIRD token remuneration. A person will be able to confirm or reject the offer.

By choosing to confirm the offer, the person will have to input all the required personal information. For example, contact details, birthday, sex, place of residence, lifestyle, habits, income, and etc. A person will receive a reward immediately.

## Working examples
Tech giants like Facebook and Google dominate of the global digital advertising market year after year. Google is likely to make $72.69 billion in ad revenues in 2017, while Facebook will make $33.76 billion. Together, that equates to a 46.4 percent share of advertisers' total global digital ad spend. 

To become world leader *both companies had to bend our perception of privacy*. 

Google saves every user’s search history. As a large part of the search giant's business model is based around advertising, it needs to know who are their users. Google uses the advantage of storing personal data. 

Facebook uses private personal data and with the help of advanced algorithms tracks users even when they are not using Facebook, because of their extensive surveillance network on sites that link to them. 

Additionally, Facebook and Google (and other companies) collect and sell not only the users' demographic data but also information about their hobbies and habits. And people get no benefits for providing this invaluable information simply by agreeing with imposed privacy policies of such tech giants. 

*As Birdchain is based upon volunteering principle*, users’ will decide how much of their personal information they are willing to relinquish. Birdchain will not store any personal consumers' information and will not share it with other parties, with the exception of the information necessary for providing Birdchain services. 

Essentially, Birdchain is disrupting the market by reinstating the control of personal data and other information back to the people.

* Team and founders **52,223,684**
* Involving corporate contributors and other expenses **87,039,474**

## Purpose of the Token
Birdchain token is NOT AN ASSET NOR A SECURITY. It is a utility token. Birdchain tokens do not represent or confer any ownership right or stake, share, security, or equivalent rights, or any right to receive dividends, other payments, intellectual property rights, or any other form of participation in or relating to the project described in this white paper and/or in Birdchain or any of its affiliates.
 
The Birdchain token holders are only entitled to use the A2P SMS distribution service as described in this document if successfully developed, or to resell the tokens.

The BIRD token itself will be based on Ethereum, a blockchain-based computing platform. Ethereum allows smart contracts, distributed computer programs that can facilitate online contractual agreements in a cryptographically secure manner.

Smart contracts are what enables the existence of Birdchain token as a truly transparent and decentralized service. This technology also ensures that Birdchain eliminates the need for intermediaries and having a central authority you need to trust. Through smart contracts the complex process of choosing peers, tracking delivery, and facilitating bidding/payment can be described in the contract itself, while still running on the distributed Ethereum network and taking advantage of the blockchain features.

BIRDs are distributed and kept on the main Ethereum network. To optimise the transaction cost and performance, all micro transactions are processed off-chain and only the final stakes are returned to the Ethereum network. We believe in idea of keeping tokens on Ethereum and see it as a bank platform which is excellent for entering exchange markets.

## Are Birdchain tokens Securities?
**No**, Birdchain tokens are not and are not intended to be securities, financial instruments, or investment products of any kind.

For example, with a purposes of financial regulation in the European Union a “security” is often defined with a reference to “transferable security” within the meaning of the EU Directive on markets in financial instruments (MiFID) . According to MiFID, “transferable securities” means those classes of securities which are negotiable on the capital market, with an exception of instruments of payment, such as:
 
1. shares in companies and other securities equivalent to shares in companies, partnerships or other entities, and depositary receipts in respect of shares;
2. bonds or other forms of securitised debt, including depositary receipts in respect of such securities;
3. any other securities giving the right to acquire or sell any such transferable securities or giving rise to a cash settlement determined by reference to transferable securities, currencies, interest rates or yields, commodities or other indices or measures.
  
BIRD does not qualify as “transferable security” for the above purposes.

BIRD as a utility token in the future will only provide opportunity to access Birdchain services. The aim of the BIRD is to make it possible to exchange SMSs between the people wishing to access them and the people wishing to dispose extra SMSs.

The BIRD has a specific utility use case. It serves a crucial role in settlement-making with a potentially very large number of mobile phones on the Birdchain network by allowing a fast and open blockchain-based transaction protocol that would not be possible using fiat currency. If the BIRD was not be based on the blockchain technology, it would be similar to purchasing a ticket or any other document which proves that the person has a right to use a particular service.

In some cases, the term “Birdchain” has also been used to refer to the service proposed to be developed by us.

Birdchain reserves the right to amend the white paper until the ICO starts.

# Exchanges
We believe that it is better to get listed in one major exchange than in couple of small ones. It will be easier for both: our contributors and companies that will use our tokens to purchase Birdchain services. We will focus on getting BIRD token listed on  **Bittrex**, **Kucoin** or some other well know exchange. Our calculations are that token will be listed within a month after our ICO.
