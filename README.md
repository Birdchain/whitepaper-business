# Roadmap

##    What We Already Have
2009-2018.01
### Knowledge. 
Since 2009, we have been working as an SMS aggregator. During the period of operation, we acquired in-depth knowledge, and the know-how about the market, operators, other aggregators, regulations and legal aspects in various regions. This experience and knowledge of the market shortcomings became the basis for Birdchain.
### Technical Base. 
In 2017 (the year is not over), we have delivered more than 200 million global SMS messages and more than 150 million global messages in 2016. To deliver such quantity of services we acquired very powerful and specific hardware and software solutions. Some of these technologies will be adapted to Birdchain to save time and cost of development.
### People. 
We gathered a proper team to bring Birdchain to the A2P SMS market and change it. All our team members have extensive experience working with A2P SMS projects, social network projects, blockchain, marketing, PR, social media, legislation and app development. These experiences are crucial to develop Birdchain app and service.
